        I was born in 1994, in the country side of Minas Gerais in Brazil. At
        school, I was always from the Exact Sciences team. I always knew that I
        want to be an engineer, but at that moment it was very difficult to
        decide which engineering.

        College

      <p>
        In 2015, I started the bachelor in Civil Engineering in the Brazilian
        Federal Center of Technology (Cefet-MG). I tried an internship in
        construction but definitely It wasn't for me. Still in college, I
        decided to try other areas by practicing.

      <p>
        I had an opportunity in an award products factory and that's where I
        started my career in finances and process automation. After 2 years
        there, I decided to look for new challenges and I changed to a
        technology startup where I continued working with finance but I had more
        contact with coding and technology. That's when I felt in love with
        coding.
