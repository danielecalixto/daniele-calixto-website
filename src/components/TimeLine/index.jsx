      <p>
        I was born in 1994, in the country side of Minas Gerais state in Brazil.
        At school, I was always from the Exact Sciences team. I always knew that
        I want to be an engineer, but at that moment it was very difficult to
        decide which engineering.
      </p>
      <h3>College</h3>
      <p>
        In 2015, I started the bachelor in Civil Engineering in the Brazilian
        Federal Center of Technology (Cefet-MG). I tried an internship in
        construction but definitely It wasn't for me. Still in college, I
        decided to try other areas by practicing.

      <h3>Working</h3>
      <p>
        I had an opportunity in an award products factory and that's where I
        started my career in finances and process automation. After 2 years
        there, I decided to look for new challenges and I changed to a
        technology startup where I continued working with finance but I had more
        contact with coding and technology.
      </p>
      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>
        In 2021, I decided for fact to stop working and immerse in studying
        technology for one year.
